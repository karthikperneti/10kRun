# 10kRun

A simple React Native app to track the training progress of a beginner runner preparing for a 10K run. The app presents an eight-week plan and allows each run to be marked as completed.

## Development

1. Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed.
2. Run the tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```
3. Use an Expo or React Native environment to run `App.js` on a mobile device or emulator.

## Project Structure
- `App.js` – main React Native application.
- `trainingPlan.js` – eight-week training plan data.
- `test.js` – basic checks for the training plan data.
